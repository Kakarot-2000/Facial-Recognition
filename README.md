# Facial Recognition
This was done to play around with some of the functions of the existing Python face_recognition and PIL libraries.
The following programs use images of people to count, compare, extract, save, and identify/label pictures.
The code can be modified to try images of any person by simply downloading the image to the Images 
folder and modifying the image path in the Python files.

## Count Faces
File: CountFaces.py

Finds the number of faces in an image and displays the count.


## Compare Faces
File: CompareFaces.py

Compare two images and see if it's of the same person.


## Extract Faces
File: ExtractFaces.py

Extract, display, and save all faces in a given image.


## Identify Faces
File: IndentifyFaces.py

Identify all faces in the image by comparing it to known images, then label the known and unknown faces.
